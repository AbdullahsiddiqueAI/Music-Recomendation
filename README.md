# Lyrics Recommendation System
This README file provides a detailed explanation of the Lyrics Recommendation System code. The system is designed to recommend similar songs based on their lyrics using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Below is a step-by-step guide to the code and its functionality.


# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

pandas
numpy
nltk
scikit-learn
pickle
You can install these libraries using pip:

# Copy code
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn pickle-mixin
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is songdata.csv. This file contains song lyrics along with additional information. Ensure this file is in the same directory as your code.

# Code Explanation
1. Importing Libraries and Reading Data
The code imports necessary libraries and reads the dataset. It samples 5000 rows from the dataset, drops the link column, and resets the index.

2. Data Preprocessing
The lyrics are converted to lowercase, punctuation is removed, and newline characters are replaced with spaces.

3. Tokenization and Stemming
A tokenization function is defined that tokenizes and stems the lyrics using NLTK's Porter Stemmer. This function is then applied to the text column.

4. TF-IDF Vectorization
TF-IDF vectorization is used to transform the lyrics into numerical vectors. Cosine similarity between these vectors is then calculated.

5. Recommendation Function
A function is defined to recommend similar songs. It finds the index of the input song, sorts the songs based on similarity scores, and returns the top 20 similar songs.

6. Saving the Model
The similarity matrix and the dataframe are saved to pickle files for later use.

# Usage
To use the recommendation system, call the recommendation function with a song title as the argument:

scss
Copy code
recommended_songs = recommendation('Alma Mater')
print(recommended_songs)
This will print a list of songs similar to "Alma Mater".

# Notes
Ensure that songdata.csv is present in the working directory.
The provided code processes a sample of 5000 songs for efficiency. You can adjust this number based on your dataset and computational resources.
The recommendation function returns the top 20 similar songs, excluding the input song itself.

# Conclusion
This README file provides a comprehensive guide to the Lyrics Recommendation System. Follow the steps and explanations to understand and implement the code effectively. If you encounter any issues, ensure all prerequisites are installed and properly configured.
